**Bcakground**:    
Urban shopping centers are evolving from pure retail destinations into vibrant, experience-driven 
ecosystems,  blending commerce,  leisure, services, and community  life. At  Unibail-Rodamco
Westfield (URW), we believe the right tenant mix is the cornerstone of a thriving place. It drives:    

📈 Footfall    

💰 Sales Maximization    

😊 Customer Satisfaction   

🛡️ Long-term Resilience    


Yet, choosing:    

• which retailers to welcome,    

• how much space to allocate, and    

• where to locate them    

all while balancing commercial performance, customer expectations, and strategic positioning
remains one of the most complex decisions in real estate management.    

With access to real-world operational and behavioral data across URW’s portfolio, this challenge 
invites us to rethink retail mix optimization from the ground up.
